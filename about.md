I'm a freelance coding architect operating under the name company name of Jaendel Heavy Industries, not because I like heavy processes (I don't) or heavy metal (I do), but because when you need something spectacular in the physical world like an oil platform or a nuclear plant you typically go to a company that has the words 'Heavy Industries' in its name. So if you need spectacular business value from your software or simply spectacular software, Jaendel Heavy Industries is your friend!

I have spent well over 20 years in the business, honing my skills in many different industries and learning from the very best during my 8 years at factor10, so today I consider myself an agnostic when it comes to tools and syntax, preferring to focus on semantics and value.

I don't mind shorter engagements, for example situational analysis and improvement planning or one or more lectures on various topics, usually connected to architecture in one way or another.
