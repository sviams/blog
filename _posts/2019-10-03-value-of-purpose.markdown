## `Purpose` => `Alignment`
And by purpose I don't mean *make a lot of money*. A well defined purpose
* guides you when prioritizing business values
* can be traced from the organizational down to the individual level

## `Alignment` => `Autonomy`
Only by using a clear and common purpose as a unifier can an organization achieve business alignment.
Alignment lets your organzation
* subdivide without major risk of counter productivity
* focus energy on the business

## `Autonomy` => `Innovation`
Having achieved autonomy and purpose, individual units of a larger organization are free to focus on mastering their field, which coincides
well with theories about productivity by [Daniel Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us) and will
ultimately result in increased creativity and innovation from within.
